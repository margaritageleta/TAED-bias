### Quiz:

We have asked students to translate some words into Catalan/Spanish from English in order to see what gender pronoun they use in the translation, this way we can detect gender biases:

<div style="width: 100%; height:200px; display:flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">  
      <div style="background-image: url('../img/conclusions/1.png'); height:100%; width:80%; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: contain; background-position:center;"></div>
</div>

Then we propose some phrases and we ask about what is the first they think:

<div style="width: 100%; height:200px; display:flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">  
      <div style="background-image: url('../img/conclusions/2.png'); height:100%; width:80%; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: contain; background-position:center;"></div>
</div>

Finally, bias can be found in 3 phases: in training data, in the algorithm itself and in validation. We have asked students, what is mode critical to deal with when trying to solve the bias issue:

<div style="width: 100%; height:200px; display:flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">  
      <div style="background-image: url('../img/conclusions/3.png'); height:100%; width:80%; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: contain; background-position:center;"></div>
</div>

### Activity 1: DEBATE algorithmic bias examples
4 interesting and contradictory situations about bias in the algorithms will be discussed. Follow this [link](https://app.mural.co/t/biascommunity5219/m/biascommunity5219/1588433438781/ba8b369bccc9c0b9250d00c34af732c5dc931618) to access the Mural!

### Activity 2: DEBATE on some of the Datasheet Questions
An activity consisting of 2 parts. It will be in the same Mural as activity 1. 

### TAKE-HOME WORK
In the take-home activity, students were asked to say which of the Datasheets points they think are the more insightful with respect to data. Just a reminder: remember that the Datsheets sections include: (1) Motivation, (2) Composition, (3) Collection Process, (4) Preprocessing, (5) Uses, (6) Distribution Process, (7) Maintenance. 

Below we show the results of the poll - 50% of the students showed to believe that the Collection Process is the most informative part regarding data.

<div style="width: 100%; height:200px; display:flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">  
      <div style="background-image: url('../img/conclusions/4.png'); height:100%; width:80%; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: contain; background-position:center;"></div>
</div>

Next, we asked students to propose key aspects for each of the above sections. What would be of maximum relevance to know regarding data if we had no available Datasheets? In the following sections we expose interesting points that Data Science students have found out.

#### Key aspects to Motivation

- **The creator of the dataset**: good reputation leads to confidence and reliability of the dataset.
- **The purpose of the dataset**: to the know Why? we can also discover some biases by knowing the original aim of the dataset.

#### Key aspects to Composition

- **The confidentiality of the data**: is the data protected? Does it include non-public content about certain individuals? We cannot break the law.
- **The dataset record**: a record of all the modifications and transformations of the dataset.

#### Key aspects to Collection Process

- **The origin**: where does the data come from? 
- **The way it was collected**: (a) Was there consent to collect this kind of data? (b) Is it reliable and trustworthy?

#### Key aspects to Preprocessing

- **Outliers & Missing values**: depending on the preprocessing done, this step can induce bias â€¦
- **Debiasing techniques**: has there been bias removal during the preprocessing stage? Describe the details needed / known. 
- **Anonymization techniques**: it is key to respect the GDPR.
- **Feature neglection**: why some features are ignored or deleted?

#### Key aspects to Uses

- **Intended tasks**: in which tasks can this dataset be used?
- **Actual tasks**: examples of use. Who used it? 
- **Licences**: are there any restrictions in use?

#### Key aspects to Distribution Process

- **Licenses, again**: who will be in control of the data? Under which regulation will be the dataset distributed? What kind of intellectual property laws reign over it?
- **Distribution channels**: how is this dataset distributed?
- **Accessibility**: is it private / public? Is it difficult to have access to the data?

#### Key aspects to Maintenance

- **Last update**: data evolves in time!
- **Update periodicity**: will it be updated when it will be needed? 
- **The way it is updated**: avoid manipulation and bias.
- **The responsible**: contact & transparency.
- **Contributions**: who can contribute?
